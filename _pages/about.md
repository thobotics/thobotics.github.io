I started my PhD at the [Autonomous Learning Robot (ALR) group](https://alr.iar.kit.edu/) in June 2023 at KIT, under the supervision of Prof. [Gerhard Neumann](https://alr.iar.kit.edu/21_65.php). Before that, I completed my Master at the Technical University of Munich and my Bachelor at the University of Information Technology in Vietnam, both majoring in Computer Science. 

My research interest includes:
* Graph Neural Networks
* Physical Modelling
* Reinforcement Learning
* Deformable Object Manipulation
